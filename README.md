# 🤖 Hugging Face Text Generation with Transformers

This project showcases how to generate natural language text using Hugging Face's `transformers` library. It is built in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates step-by-step how to load a pretrained model, configure generation parameters, and produce coherent and context-aware text.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and use pretrained models from Hugging Face (e.g., GPT-2)
- Tokenize text inputs for model compatibility
- Generate text based on custom prompts
- Experiment with generation parameters (like max length, sampling, temperature, etc.)
- Return multiple generations for creative outputs

## 📚 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Hugging Face `transformers`
- PyTorch backend
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Model Used

The example primarily uses:

- `GPT-2` (via `transformers.pipeline("text-generation")`)

However, it can easily be adapted for other models like `GPT-Neo`, `Bloom`, `LLaMA`, etc., by changing model IDs and configurations.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
### 2.Install the required libraries:

```pip install transformers torch```

### Open the notebook:

Use Jupyter or VSCode to open Hugging_Face_Text_Generation.ipynb.

### Run the notebook:

Run all cells to see the text generation pipeline in action.

### 📝 Example Output
Prompt:

"Artificial intelligence is transforming"
Generated Output:
"Artificial intelligence is transforming the world in unexpected ways. From healthcare to transportation, AI is making systems smarter and more efficient..."

### 🧩 Customization Tips

Use do_sample=True and adjust temperature for more creative outputs.
Set num_return_sequences > 1 to get multiple generation options.
Change the model by updating model="gpt2" to another Hugging Face model checkpoint.
